# Cook-Ani-thing

Alright, this is just a project I created to expirement with a JSON file and React. The data for the various recipies is retrived from the JSON file and dynamically displayed
through JS Array Methods such as Map. I also implemented a Search functionality. I did plan on including a Create part for the website too. But the Create hook I made collapsed
, leaving me clueless about what to do next. So I shut down that part of the app. Note : the Data is being retreived from a local server and not any registered database.
